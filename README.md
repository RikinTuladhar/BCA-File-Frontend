<h2 align="left">Languages and Tools:</h2>
<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage using a series of elements, each defined by tags.</p>



<h3> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
<p>
  CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows developers to apply styles such as fonts, colors, and spacing to web pages, enhancing the look and feel of the site. CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes.
</p>


<h3>JavaScript (JS)</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is an essential part of web applications, allowing for client-side scripting to create dynamic content. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, and interact with APIs.</p>

<h3>Tailwind CSS</h3>
<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that can be composed to build complex designs directly in the markup. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization.</p>

<h3>React</h3>
<p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.</p>

<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.</p>
